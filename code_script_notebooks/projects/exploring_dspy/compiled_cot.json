        "rationale": "produce the answer. We know that Ella got 4 incorrect answers, so she got 36 correct answers out of 40. Half of 36 is 18, and 6 more than that is 24. Therefore, Marion got 24 correct answers out of 40.",

        "rationale": "produce the answer. We know that Stephen made 10 round trips up and down the mountain, reaching 3\/4 of the mountain's height each time. This means he covered 3\/4 * 40,000 feet = 30,000 feet on each trip. Since he made 10 round trips, the total distance he covered is 30,000 feet * 10 trips * 2 (round trip) = 600,000 feet.",

How many more shooting stars did Sam count in the night sky than was the average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them?",
        "rationale": "produce the answer. We know that Reginald counted two fewer shooting stars than Bridget, so he counted 14 - 2 = 12 shooting stars. Sam counted four more shooting stars than Reginald, so he counted 12 + 4 = 16 shooting stars. The total number of shooting stars counted by the three of them is 14 + 12 + 16 = 42. The average number of shooting stars observed for the three of them is 42 \/ 3 = 14. Therefore, Sam counted 16 - 14 = 2 more shooting stars than the average number observed.",

Then we triple the number of pencils she bought on Tuesday, which is 18 * 3 = 54 pencils.

Officers who have served at least three years get an additional 25% off the discounted price. How much does an officer who has served at least three years have to pay for shoes?",
        "rationale": "produce the answer. We first calculate the 20% discount for serving at least a year, which is 0.20 * 85 = $17. Then we subtract this discount from the original price to get $85 - $17 = $68. Next, we calculate the additional 25% discount for serving at least three years, which is 0.25 * 68 = $17.
