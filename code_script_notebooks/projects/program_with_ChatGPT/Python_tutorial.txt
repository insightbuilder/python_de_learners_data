x1, y1 = map(float, input("Enter the coordinates of point 1 (x y): ").split())
x2, y2 = map(float, input("Enter the coordinates of point 2 (x y): ").split())
distance = math.sqrt((x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2)
print("The distance between the two points is:", round(distance, 2))
```

14. Problem Statement: Create a program that converts a decimal number to binary.

Solution Explanation: The program will prompt the user to enter a decimal number and then convert it to binary.

Python Code Example:

```python
decimal = int(input("Enter a decimal number: "))
binary = bin(decimal)[2:]
print("The binary representation of", decimal, "is:", binary)
```

15. Problem Statement: Create a program that calculates the area and perimeter of a rectangle.

Solution Explanation: The program will prompt the user to enter the length and width of a rectangle and then calculate its area and perimeter.

Python Code Example:

```python
length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))
area = length * width
perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
print("The area of the rectangle is:", area)
print("The perimeter of the rectangle is:", perimeter)
```

File Handling:

```python
# Writing to a file
with open("file.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, world!")

# Reading from a file
with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    contents = f.read()
    print(contents)

# Appending to a file
with open("file.txt", "a") as f:
    f.write("\nThis is a new line.")

# Reading line by line from a file
with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line.strip())
```

Object-Oriented Programming:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def say_hello(self):
        print("Hello, my name is", self.name, "and I am", self.age, "years old.")

class Student(Person):
    def __init__(self, name, age, grade):
        super().__init__(name, age)
        self.grade = grade

    def say_hello(self):
        super().say_hello()
        print("I am in grade", self.grade)

person = Person("John", 30)
person.say_hello()

student = Student("Jane", 15, 9)
student.say_hello()

 I have better understanding of python programming in 
the real world. Generate 1 project idea for a full stack application 
involving supply chain and manufacturing using python. Thing step by step 
about the projects. Then list the python libraries and example code  
that is required for each step.******Completion starts****** 
One project idea for a full stack application involving supply chain and manufacturing using Python could be a system for tracking inventory and production in a manufacturing facility. This system would allow managers to monitor inventory levels, track production progress, and generate reports on production efficiency.

Step 1: Design the database schema
- Use SQLAlchemy to create a database schema for storing inventory and production data
- Example code: 
```
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

engine = create_engine('sqlite:///inventory.db')
Base = declarative_base()

class Product(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'products'
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    quantity = Column(Integer)
    # add more columns as needed

Base.metadata.create_all(engine)
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()
```

Step 2: Build the backend API
- Use Flask to build a RESTful API for accessing and updating inventory and production data
- Example code:
```
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///inventory.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class Product(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String)
    quantity = db.Column(db.Integer)
    # add more columns as needed

@app.route('/products', methods=['GET'])
def get_products():
    products = Product.query.all()
    return jsonify([product.serialize() for product in products])

@app.route('/products/<int:id>', methods=['GET'])
def get_product(id):
    product = Product.query.get(id)
    return jsonify(product.serialize())

@app.route('/products', methods=['POST'])
def create_product():
    data = request.get_json()
    product = Product(name=data['name'], quantity=data['quantity'])
    db.session.add(product)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify(product.serialize()), 201

# add more API endpoints as needed
```

Step 3: Build the frontend UI
- Use React to build a user interface for viewing and updating inventory and production data
- Example code:
```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function App() {
  const [products, setProducts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get('/products')
      .then(response => setProducts(response.data))
      .catch(error => console.log(error));
  }, []);

  const handleCreateProduct = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    const name = event.target.elements.name.value;
    const quantity = event.target.elements.quantity.value;
    axios.post('/products', { name, quantity })
      .then(response => setProducts([...products, response.data]))
      .catch(error => console.log(error));
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Inventory Management System</h1>
      <form onSubmit={handleCreateProduct}>
        <label>
          Name:
          <input type="text" name="name" />
        </label>
        <label>
          Quantity:
          <input type="number" name="quantity" />
        </label>
        <button type="submit">Create Product</button>
      </form>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Quantity</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          {products.map(product => (
            <tr key={product.id}>
              <td>{product.name}</td>
              <td>{product.quantity}</td>
            </tr>
          ))}
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Step 4: Add authentication and authorization
- Use Flask-Login and Flask-JWT-Extended to add authentication and authorization to the API
- Example code:
```
from flask_login import UserMixin, LoginManager, login_required, current_user
from flask_jwt_extended import JWTManager, jwt_required, create_access_token

app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'secret'
app.config['JWT_SECRET_KEY'] = 'jwt_secret'
login_manager = LoginManager(app)
jwt = JWTManager(app)

class User(db.Model, UserMixin):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String, unique=True)
    password = db.Column(db.String)

@login_manager.user_loader
def load_user(user_id):
    return User.query.get(int(user_id))

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    data = request.get_json()
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=data['username']).first()
    if user and user.password == data['password']:
        access_token = create_access_token(identity=user.id)
        return jsonify(access_token=access_token)
    else:
        return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid username or password'}), 401

@app.route('/products', methods=['GET'])
@jwt_required
def get_products():
    products = Product.query.all()
    return jsonify([product.serialize() for product in products])

@app.route('/products/<int:id>', methods=['GET'])
@jwt_required
def get_product(id):
    product = Product.query.get(id)
    return jsonify(product.serialize())

@app.route('/products', methods=['POST'])
@jwt_required
def create_product():
    data = request.get_json()
    product = Product(name=data['name'], quantity=data['quantity'])
    db.session.add(product)
    db.session.commit()
    return jsonify(product.serialize()), 201

@app.route('/logout', methods=['POST'])
@login_required
def logout():
    logout_user()
    return jsonify({'message': 'Logged out successfully'})
```

Python libraries used:
- SQLAlchemy for database management
- Flask for building the API
- Flask-Login and Flask-JWT-Extended for authentication and authorization
- React for building the frontend UI
- Axios for making API requests from the frontend

Please provide me the alternate way to implement the [Code]******Completion starts****** 
An alternate way to implement the code would be to use a list comprehension to get the temperatures and then calculate the average using the built-in `mean()` function from the `statistics` module. Here's the code:

```
import statistics

temperatures = [float(input(f"Enter temperature for day {i+1}: ")) for i in range(7)]
average_temp = statistics.mean(temperatures)

print("The average temperature for the week is:", round(average_temp, 2))
```

This code does the same thing as the original code, but uses a list comprehension to get the temperatures and the `mean()` function from the `statistics` module to calculate the average.*****Completion ends******
